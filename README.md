# Teachable Machine Community

This repository contains parts of Teachable Machine that can be contributed to by community. Its split up into two sections, [snippets](/snippets) and [librarires](/librarires). 

The snippets are markdown files that are shown inside the [Teachable Machine](https://teachablemachine.withgoogle.com) tool, that are meant as starting points to use the trained models outside the tool.

The librarires folder is for helper libraries that makes it easier to use the models outside the tool. [Read more](/libraries)
